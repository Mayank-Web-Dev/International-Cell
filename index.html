                    <p>Namaste! I’m Antra Babel and I recently got an opportunity from Christ University to go on a cultural exchange to South Korea, Hala University. The program was well established, well organised in terms of finance, in terms of food, in terms of accommodation, in terms of transport, in terms of field visits, in terms of souvenirs, in terms of people… it was an amazing experience! We went to Hala group of Industries, Hala Logistics, Unification Centre. The most amazing experience of mine in South Korea was going to worth Korea- North Korea Border and there we visited the unification centre where South Korea is still planning to get unified with North Korea. In psychological terms, we got to understand what culture means. How humanity and empathy can connect two cultures. So that was an amazing experience for me. Thank you!</p>
